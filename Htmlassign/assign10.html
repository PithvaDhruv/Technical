                <h2>OnePlus 13T tipped to launch in April:</h2>

                <p >    OnePlus is reportedly working on a new compact smartphone that might come with a bigger battery than the company’s latest flagship – the OnePlus 13. According to the known tipster Digital Chat Station, who recently posted on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, the upcoming phone will have a 6.3-inch screen with 1.5K resolution and pack an impressive 6,200mAh battery.

                    <br>    While the tipster did not explicitly mention the name of the phone, numerous rumours suggest that it will be the OnePlus 13T, which may be rebranded to OnePlus 13 Mini in some markets. Speculations also suggest that the device will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, support 80W wired charging and get the new customisable button, which OnePlus said will replace the iconic Alert Slider.</p>

                <p>OpenAI announced an enhanced image-generation capability on ChatGPT, powered by GPT-4o. Available for Plus, Pro, Team, and Free users, as well as developers via API, it is said to be capable of generating images that are “not only beautiful but useful.”

                    “It’s an incredible technology/product. I remember seeing some of the first images come out of this model and having a hard time believing they were really made by AI. We think people will love it, and we are excited to see the resulting creativity,” wrote Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, in an X post.</p>
